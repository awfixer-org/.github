<p> Fixing the world, one friendship at a time </p>

we currently have a community on [Discord](https://discord.awfixer.com) though there is plans to build our own chat platform in the future.

we have major projects in this org like our fork of stoat, our networking work, AWFixerOS and more. Questions are to be directed to either the Discord or the Discussions of each repo.
