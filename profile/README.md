<p> Fixing the world, one friendship at a time </p>

we currently have a community on [Discord](https://discord.awfixer.com) though there is plans to build our own chat platform in the future.

Our goal is to create new and improved versions of things like Operating Systems, Hardware, Networking, etc. Because the internet needs to modernize, or become obsolete.

<h2> <a href="https://discord.com/events/1411638016572784722/1455704617970041090">Community Sync</a> </h2>

We will begin hosting a community sync on Discord in a few weeks to ensure that our ideas are properly expressed and community feedback is properly handled. You can join the [Discord](https://discord.awfixer.com), the community sync will be held on this [Event Stage](https://discord.com/channels/1411638016572784722/1444452210623647814) which will only be visible when the sync or another event is about to happen and will be hidden shortly after to help keep the community clean.
